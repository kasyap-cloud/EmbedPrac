        "Company Description": "The year was 2014. Software development was becoming increasingly commoditized. Speed and cost issues were taking priority over strategy, execution, and long-term scalability. Growth-stage companies were getting caught in the middle of it all. If they turned to one of the many smaller dev shops that emerged, they wouldn’t get the strategic capabilities and thinking needed to make their project successful. But if they went with a big consulting firm, the costs would be prohibitive.\n\nThat’s when a group of consulting and technology veterans came together over a new idea for software development. They knew that developers would get better results if they had more time to think through their projects before rushing straight to coding. And they wanted to start an employee-focused company that was all about enabling developers to do their best work. So they created a new model for outsourced development where developers would spend 80% of their time thinking about the solution and 20% coding it. This would give smaller companies the strategic thinking needed to compete with much larger corporations.\n\nToday, thinkbridge is how mid-market companies turn into tech disruptors, drive growth, and increase their valuations. Middle market leaders are no longer stuck between the limitless costs of big consulting firms and the limited capabilities of smaller dev shops. With a unique “think bigger, move faster, go further” approach to technology innovation, thinkbridge has achieved a client NPS rating in the 90s and a client retention rate of over 90%.\n\nthinkbridge.

Every company has different inferencing needs: *One size does not fit all.* Businesses need control to manage their cost <> performance tradeoffs. Hence, the movement towards open-source usage: businesses prefer small niche models trained on relevant datasets over large generalist models that do not justify ROI.\n\n**Need for MLOps platform***\n\nDeploying large models comes with its hurdles: access to compute, model optimisation, scaling infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and cost efficiency, all requiring highly skilled machine learning engineers. We need a tool to support this advent towards generative AI, as we had tools to transition to cloud and mobile. MLOps platforms simplify orchestration workflows for in-house deployment cycles.
